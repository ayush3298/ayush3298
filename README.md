### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
A self taught programmer with experience in development of systems in various domains. A key component of my success lies in the fact that I never limit myself to a particular technology as a core skill and hence, Iâ€™ve always embraced new technologies.  
My key skill has been to independently author processes improving utility tools and APIs, in many programming languages.
As a hobby, I love to explore github to find out what the open source communities are developing. In short, someone who encourages learning and the sharing of ideas and is always open to new ways of working.
